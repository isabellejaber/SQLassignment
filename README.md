ASSIGNMENT FOR BRAINSTATION

In this assignment, I was required to craft the following SQL queries based on the provided database
In your queries, specify the database and table when retrieving data

1. Retrieve the `usernames` and email addresses of all users from the `user` table.

2. Retrieve the `credit card statements`, including the merchant `name` and `amount`, along with the corresponding `usernames`.

3. Calculate the `total amount` spent by each `user` on `credit card transactions`.

4. Retrieve all the utility bills with `amounts greater than $50`.

5. Add a new user to the `user` table with the following information:
- Item username: "pavel_polak"
- Item email: "pavel_polak@test-email.com"
- Item password hash: (1901a15662db83ab4b9e9448b83ace0f2ba02b34a090711525018f65d42b0d67)

6. Update the `budget limit` in the `budget_categories` table for the category "Travel" to $500 for the user with the `username "angela_marino"`.

7. Delete all `credit card statements` with an `amount less than $10`.

8. Retrieve the `usernames`, `category names`, and `total expenses` for each user in the `"Travel"` category.

9. For the `user` with the username "rhian_thompson-russel," determine the `remaining budget` for the `"Health"` category in the current month. Consider the `budget limit` from the `budget_categories` table and subtract the total expenses from the `user_expenses` table for that `category` and `user`.
